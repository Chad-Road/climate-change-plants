# climate-change-plants
Note: This project will be built in several standalone chunks starting with
1. Temperature-Humidity associations
2. Identifying prime global flora locations
3. Predicting temp, humidity, moisture in curerent locations
4. Identifying highest production food crops and their needs
5. Identifying which crops are at highest risk
## Goal

Analysis to predict areas that will become more or less hospital to certain plants, primarily food crops, due to the effects of climate change.

## How climate affects plants

Plants are primarily affected by five factors:
1. Solar radiation
2. Percipitation (rain)
3. Relative humidity
4. Average, min, and max temperature
5. Growing season

Of these five factors, only solar radiation is expected to remain constant. It's reasonable to expect changes in precipitation (and drought), humidity, temperature and growing season.If the system were more simplistic, each of these factors would likely be to small and/or slow to make any significant changes to plant growth. 

## Climate and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)
### How changing climate affects plants

The primary complicating factor in climate change, at least in relation to plants, is the complex interactions between percipitation, relative humidity, and temperature. While there are some issues connected with increases in temperature increasing loss in soil moisture through humidity, the greater cause for concern are the changes in vapor pressure deficit (VPD).
Vapor pressure deficit essentially measures the the speed and severity that moisture is pulled from plants and is primarily affected by relative humidty and temperature. As temperature increases, if absolute humidity stays the same, the relative humidity of the air goes down due to warmer air being able to hold more moisture. This is
relevant because as plants transpire they lose moisture more quickly when humidity is low and temperature is high (e.g. high vapor pressure deficit). 

### Vapor pressure deficit problems

High vapor pressure deficit presents two probelms. First plants are more likely to use up the avialable water more quickly, and second they can suffer from nutrient toxicity due to pulling more nutriet rich water into the plant
Low vapor pressure deficit presents the opposite problems. First plants stay too moist and more likely to suffer from mold or other pests, and second they can become nutrient deficient due to not pulling less nutreint rich water from the soil. This is true even if the soil is properly fertilized.
This is primarily relevant because while global temperatures are rising, the average relative humidity on land is decreasing--though is increasing in some parts of india and other high altitue regions. This combination of increased temperature and lower relative humidity will become increasingly problematic as changes in vapor pressure deficit change the suitibility of certain crops for certain regions of the globe.
